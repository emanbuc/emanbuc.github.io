# Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based platform for building and operating machine learning solutions in Azure. It includes a wide range of features and capabilities that help data scientists prepare data, train models, publish predictive services, and monitor their usage. Most importantly, it helps data scientists increase their efficiency by automating many of the time-consuming tasks associated with training models; and it enables them to use cloud-based compute resources that scale effectively to handle large volumes of data while incurring costs only when actually used.

## Azure MAchine Learning Workspace

To use Azure Machine Learning, you create a workspace in your Azure subscription. You can then use this workspace to manage data, compute resources, code, models, and other artifacts related to your machine learning workloads.

## Compute Resources

There are four kinds of compute resource you can create:

- Compute Instances: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
- Compute Clusters: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
- Inference Clusters: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
- Attached Compute: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.
