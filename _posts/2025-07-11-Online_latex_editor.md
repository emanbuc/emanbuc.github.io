**Date:** September 11, 2025

## Abstract

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of online LaTeX editors and collaboration tools designed for academic writing. We examine leading platforms including Overleaf, Papeeria, Authorea, and other alternatives, comparing their features, pricing models, and collaborative capabilities. Special attention is given to available AI powered writing assistant and to data security and privacy compliance (particularly GDPR) for protecting sensitive academic content. Users should choose the solution that best fit requirements and budget constrains. Our analysis reveals that while in online LaTeX editors offer significant advantages for collaborative academic writing, institutions must carefully evaluate security implications when handling sensitive research data. Different set of features are made available at a cost ranging from free plan up to 40 €/month.

## Introduction

LaTeX has become the gold standard for academic and scientific document preparation, especially in fields requiring complex notation, precise formatting, and strong bibliographic management. The evolution from desktop to cloud-based collaborative platforms has revolutionized research workflows.

Online LaTeX editors combine powerful typesetting with modern collaboration tools, enabling real-time editing, version control, and sharing across teams.

## Online LaTeX Editors

The most popular and widely used online LaTeX editor is *Overleaf*, known for its collaborative features, real-time editing, document sharing, and extensive template library, making it a standard tool for academic and technical writing worldwide. Other popular online editors include *Papeeria* (https://papeeria.com) and *Authorea* (https://www.authorea.com). Beyond the most popular and established platforms, a new generation of online LaTeX editors is gaining traction. Also cloud based managed computation platforms such as *CoCal* (https://cocalc.com/) that include a LaTeX editor should be considered.

### Getting started

All online LaTeX featured a very friendly on-boarding process that allow the user to start writing in less than 2 minutes. Only an e-mail address is required activate a fee plan instance. *CoCal*, due to the different nature of the platform, require some more effort for the initial setup and do not provide a free plan.

Modern online LaTeX platforms are increasingly embedding AI-powered assistants to streamline writing, debugging, and formatting workflows. By leveraging these AI assistants, researchers can focus more on substantive content and less on low-level formatting, making LaTeX more accessible to novices and veterans alike. Below are several concrete implementations.

**Writefull** (an add-on for Overleaf) offers AI-powered language assistance tailored for academic writing.

#### Intelligent Autocompletion and Error Detection

Crixet's "Chirp" co-pilot (https://crixet.com/) uses AI to offer context-aware suggestions for macros, environments, and symbols, plus inline error detection that highlights compilation issues in real time.

#### Natural Language to LaTeX Conversion

Overleaf's integration with Paperpal (https://paperpal.com/) lets users describe content in plain English—such as "a quadratic formula"—and receive fully formatted LaTeX code in seconds.

#### Voice and Sketch-Driven Content Creation

Crixet (https://crixet.com/) allows voice dictation or freehand sketches to generate LaTeX code and vector graphics, accelerating drafts for users less familiar with raw syntax.

#### Grammar and Style Coaching

Writefull AI (https://writefull.com/) integrates directly into Overleaf, providing academic-style grammar checks, passive-voice alerts, and rephrasing suggestions that respect LaTeX document structure.

#### Citation and Bibliography Automation

TeXPage (https://www.texpage.com/) features AI-driven citation lookup with one-click DOI metadata retrieval, seamless Zotero integration, and automatic bibliography formatting for both numbered and author–year styles.

### Technical Safeguards

All use HTTPS/TLS, encryption at rest, containerization, regular backups.

### Academic Risks

Sensitive/unpublished content, patent material, or personal health data should be handled per institutional protocols. Platforms have had vulnerabilities in the past (e.g., ShareLaTeX command execution flaws), now mitigated with sandboxing and improved filtering.

### Security Best Practices

Institutions should:

- Train users on sensitive content recognition

- Implement SSO/access controls

- Audit usage and backups

- Employ hybrid models for sensitive research

## Comparative Recommendations

Based on the present survey and 5 years of daily user experience my favorite tools is *Overleaf*, but it is also the most expensive. I found a better features versus cost balance in *TextPage* and *www.papeeria.com* 5 € per month plans. My general advise are:

- If your research institution provide institutional account probably you should take advantage of this benefit.

- Create a free account, import a project representative of you typical paper a try to work on the project for at lest few hours. Some days is better if possible.

- If you are a *privacy-focused* user (or you have to work under security constrains) consider on-premises solutions or at least an hybrid solution with most sensitive data keep in private server while using a public cloud based collaboration platform. EU based platform and data center may also help with security and privacy requirements.

## Future Trends

AI integration (grammar, citation management, formula generation) are rising, with privacy risks to consider. End-to-end encryption, decentralized models, and zero-trust architectures are on the horizon.

## Conclusion

Online LaTeX editors have radically improved academic writing workflows, with Overleaf leading in features and adoption. Data security and institutional policy remain central: hybrid approaches, regular audits, and robust training enable safe, productive research collaboration.
