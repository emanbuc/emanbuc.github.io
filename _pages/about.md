I am an **Italian Software Engineer** and researcher with a lifelong passion for the intersection of science and technology. My journey has been defined by a dual commitment to industrial innovation and academic rigor, allowing me to bridge the gap between complex theory and practical, scalable software solutions.

### Industrial Experience

Since 2019, I have served as the **Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Smartpeg**, where I lead the development of data-driven software solutions for Human Resource management and AI-powered intelligence tools. I first joined Smartpeg in 2016, diving deep into Industrial IoT and Machine Learning. Prior to this, I gained extensive experience in technical and managerial roles across the electronics and fashion sectors, working with multinational companies both in Italy and abroad. To complement my technical background, I earned my **MBA in 2011**, which helps me navigate the strategic side of technology management.

### Research & Academia

In 2024, I completed my **Ph.D. in Industrial and Information Engineering** at the University of Perugia. My research focuses on **uncertainty quantification** in machine learning-based systems. I currently serve as a Subject Expert and Research Affiliate at the University’s Department of Engineering. My scientific work sits at the crossroads of **Artificial Intelligence, Electronic Measurements, and Software Engineering**, with a specific focus on applying metrological concepts to AI to improve reliability, interpretability, and sustainability.

### Technical Expertise

Beyond AI and ML, I have a broad interest in the modern software ecosystem, including:

* **Cloud Computing & Cloud-native Architectures**
* **DevOps & Cybersecurity**
* **Internet of Things (IoT)**
* **Software Quality & Characterization**
* **Software Engineering** 

I am an active member of the **ACM** and the **IEEE** (Computer Society and Instrumentation & Measurement Society), staying at the forefront of the global conversation on reliable technology.
