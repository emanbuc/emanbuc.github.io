I found a better features versus cost balance in <em>TextPage</em> and <em>www.papeeria.com</em> 5 € per month plans. My general advise are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If your research institution provide institutional account probably you should take advantage of this benefit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a free account, import a project representative of you typical paper a try to work on the project for at lest few hours. Some days is better if possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are a <em>privacy-focused</em> user (or you have to work under security constrains) consider on-premises solutions or at least an hybrid solution with most sensitive data keep in private server while using a public cloud based collaboration platform. EU based platform and data center may also help with security and privacy requirements.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="future-trends">Future Trends</h2> <p>AI integration (grammar, citation management, formula generation) are rising, with privacy risks to consider. End-to-end encryption, decentralized models, and zero-trust architectures are on the horizon.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Online LaTeX editors have radically improved academic writing workflows, with Overleaf leading in features and adoption. Data security and institutional policy remain central: hybrid approaches, regular audits, and robust training enable safe, productive research collaboration.</p> </body></html>
