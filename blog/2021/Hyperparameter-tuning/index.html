Depending on the algorithm used, you may need to specify hyperparameters to configure how the model is trained.</p> <p>For example, the logistic regression algorithm uses a regularization rate hyperparameter to counteract overfitting; and deep learning techniques for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use hyperparameters like learning rate to control how weights are adjusted during training, and batch size to determine how many data items are included in each training batch.</p> <p>Data scientists refer to the values determined from the training features as <em>parameters</em>, <strong>values that are used to configure training behavior but which are not derived from the training data</strong> are named <em>hyperparameter</em>.</p> <p>The choice of hyperparameter values can significantly affect the resulting model, making it important to select the best possible values.</p> <p>Hyperparameter tuning is accomplished by training the multiple models, using the same algorithm and training data but different hyperparameter values. The resulting model from each training run is then evaluated to determine the performance metric for which you want to optimize (for example, <em>accuracy</em>), and the best-performing model is selected.</p> <p>In Azure Machine Learning, you achieve this through an <em>experiment</em> that consists of a <em>hyperdrive run</em>, which initiates a child run for each hyperparameter combination to be tested. Each child run uses a training script with parameterized hyperparameter values to train a model, and logs the target performance metric achieved by the trained model.</p> <p>Hyperdrive run configuration must include:</p> <ul> <li>hyperparameter search space.</li> <li>hyperparameter sampling.</li> <li>early-termination policy.</li> </ul> <h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2> <h3 id="grid-sampling">Grid Sampling</h3> <p>Grid Sampling is used to try every possible combination of parameters in the search space.</p> <pre><code class="language-Python">from azureml.train.hyperdrive import GridParameterSampling, choice

To prevent wasting time and money, in addition to a maximum number of rins, you can set an <strong>early termination policy</strong> that abandons runs that are unlikely to produce a better result than previously completed runs.</p> <p>The policy is evaluated at an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">evaluation_interval</code> you specify. You can also set a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delay_evaluation</code> parameter to avoid evaluating the policy until a minimum number of iterations have been completed.</p> <p>Early termination is particularly useful for deep learning scenarios where a deep neural network (DNN) is trained iteratively over a number of epochs. The training script can report the target metric after each epoch, and if the run is significantly underperforming previous runs after the same number of intervals, it can be abandoned.</p> <h3 id="bandit-policy">Bandit Policy</h3> <p>Use a bandit policy to stop a run if the target performance metric underperforms the best run so far by a specified margin expressed as absolute value (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slack_amount</code>) or factor (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slack_factor</code>)</p> <p>This example applies the policy for every iteration after the first five, and abandons runs where the reported target metric is 0.2 or more worse than the best performing run after the same number of intervals.</p> <pre><code class="language-Python">from azureml.train.hyperdrive import BanditPolicy
